tests
- fix update tests
- tests for service layer? - YES!  Are they actually calling db and getting something back?
- error handling for conditions like 'id not found', or can't delete wrestler b/c FK to matches

#1a cleanup
- normalize language (example... is it create?  or add?  remove or delete?)
- match language between tests and controllers
- models... should it be plural or singular?  Wrestlers or Wrestler?

functions
- add shows
- deactivate vs delete wrestlers... determine functionality
- tag matches and other match types
- a front end at some point?

learn
- tdd (use shows creation?  Or something more interesting?)
- containers
- returning matches with wrestler names... in service layer?  SQL view?  Presentation/React?


#1c models
- matches... revisit this.  Instead of using an int for wrestler... use the whole wrestler object!  Consider List<Wresters>
parent/child spring boot db entity objects

#1b teams
- create team model + teams controller(or should it be part of match creation?... 
     annotation in matchesController to create team, but NOT creation wrestler)
